## Project Overview

As part of a data analysis project from an online Coursera course, I completed a comprehensive analysis of the Cyclistic bike-share program, a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago. This project aimed to uncover insights into how Cyclistic's casual riders and annual members use their bike-share service differently. The ultimate goal was to develop a data-driven marketing strategy to increase yearly memberships, which are more profitable for the company.

## Project Role

In this project, I assumed the role of a Junior Data Analyst on the Cyclistic marketing analytics team. My primary task was to analyze historical trip data to answer the critical business question: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" My findings would inform recommendations for a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Processed 12 months of historical bike trip data, ensuring data integrity and preparing it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the data to uncover patterns in usage between casual riders and annual members, focusing on ride length, day of the week, and time of day.
- **Data Visualization:** Created clear, insightful visualizations using tools such as R and Google Sheets to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
- **Insight Generation:** Derived actionable insights that could guide the development of targeted marketing strategies.
- **Reporting:** Compiled findings into a comprehensive report, including visualizations and strategic recommendations, for Cyclistic's executive team.

## Data Sources

For this project, I utilized publicly available Cyclistic historical trip data. The data was anonymized to ensure user privacy and included detailed records of each bike trip, such as start and end times, trip duration, and user type (casual or member).

## Analysis Summary

The analysis revealed significant differences in how casual riders and annual members use the Cyclistic service:

- **Ride Length:** Casual riders generally took longer trips than annual members.
- **Day of the Week:** Casual riders were more active on weekends, while annual members showed a more consistent usage pattern throughout the week.
- **Time of Day:** Casual riders typically rented bikes during mid-day, whereas annual members were more likely to use them during morning and evening rush hours.

These insights suggest that casual riders use the service more for leisure, while annual members tend to use it for commuting.

## Key Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I proposed three strategic recommendations:

1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Develop marketing campaigns focused on converting casual riders into annual members by highlighting the cost savings and convenience for regular commuters.
2. **Weekend Specials:** Offer special promotions or incentives for casual riders who frequently use the service on weekends to encourage them to switch to an annual membership.
3. **Membership Trials:** Introduce a trial membership program that allows casual riders to experience the benefits of being an annual member for a limited time before committing to a full membership.

## Conclusion

This project enhanced my ability to analyze complex datasets and generate actionable business insights. The findings and recommendations provided could significantly influence Cyclistic's marketing strategies, potentially leading to an increase in annual memberships and overall profitability.
