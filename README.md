Project Background
In 2016, Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, launched its bike-sharing program with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles distributed across 692 stations. The program has since grown and become popular among both locals and tourists, offering a flexible and convenient transportation option. Cyclistic distinguishes itself by providing a range of bicycles, including traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making the service inclusive for people with disabilities.

The company's primary focus has been on building brand awareness and attracting a broad consumer base through flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Cyclistic's finance team has identified that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders, prompting the marketing team to explore strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

The company's success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships, which led to the initiation of this project. The project aims to analyze how different user segments—casual riders and annual members—utilize Cyclistic's bike-sharing service, with the goal of identifying actionable insights that can drive marketing strategies to increase membership conversion rates.

Project Definition
The primary objective of this project is to understand the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-sharing service between two key user segments: casual riders and annual members. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the project seeks to uncover significant differences in how these two groups use the service, with the ultimate goal of informing a new marketing strategy that encourages casual riders to become annual members.

The project is structured around answering three central questions:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders be motivated to purchase annual memberships?
How can digital media be leveraged to influence casual riders to convert to annual members?
This analysis will be used to create data-driven recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing team, ensuring that the proposed strategies are backed by compelling insights and visualizations that can effectively communicate the findings to the company's executive team.
